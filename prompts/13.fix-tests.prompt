# Objective
Fix all improper tests:                                                                                                                                          

# Context
    For we're not calling searchTorrent explicitly on search clicks or page changes, instead we rely on onMounted hook to be triggered after new query is pushed to route, 
    so we in test we should not spy on searchTorrentAPI, instead, spy on syncParamsToUrl being called and params are sync to URL properly by spy on router.push being called with proper query.                                                                                                                             

   E.g., in handleSearch, remove code that spies on mockTorrentAPI.searchTorrent. Spy on syncParamsToUrl, and spy on router.push being called with query of correct keyword.
